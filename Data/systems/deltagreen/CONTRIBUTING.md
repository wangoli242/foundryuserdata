## Tooling

**If you don't already know what a formatter and linter are, read the following guide, the sections "Formatters" and "Linters", especially: [Formatters, linters, and compilers: Oh my!](https://github.com/readme/guides/formatters-linters-compilers)**

### Formatters

- JavaScript, JSON, CSS: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/install)
- Handlebars: [DJLint](https://djlint.com/docs/getting-started/)

### Linters

- JavaScript: [Eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/getting-started)
- Markdown: [Markdownlint](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)
- Handlebars: DJLint (see above)
- CSS: VSCode Built-in

### Misc

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) - Used to standardize file configurations like tabs vs. spaces, end-of-line characters, etc.
- [FVTT CLI](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt-cli) - Used to package document JSON files into LevelDB packs, and vice-versa. In simpler terms, this lets us convert documents in compendia into JSON files, OR turn those JSON files back into documents in the compendia.

### VSCode Extensions

These extensions will be auto-recommended to install. If you do not use VSCode, there are likely integrations with your code editor.

- [dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [esbenp.prettier-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [monosans.djlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monosans.djlint)
- [DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- [EditorConfig.EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

## Setting up a Development Environment

To test or develop for the system, you want a local environment where you can test and make your changes safely. This section will help you get everything set up.

### 1. Install Git

If you haven’t already, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/). It allows you to clone the repository and contribute code.

In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to keep the repository. Then, clone the repository:

- via HTTPS:
  `git clone https://github.com/deltagreen-foundryvtt/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system.git`
- via SSH (preferred if you have SSH keys set up):
  `git clone git@github.com:deltagreen-foundryvtt/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system.git`

Then navigate into the cloned folder:

```bash
cd delta-green-foundry-vtt-system
```

### 2. Install Node.js and NPM

Download and install the [LTS version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which includes `npm` (Node Package Manager). This is used to install dependencies and run project tooling like linters and formatters.

Verify installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

1. Navigate to the project directory and run the following:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This installs all required development packages, such as `prettier`, `eslint`, and the others listed in `package.json`.

2. Install `djlint` (doesn't come through NPM). This requires `Python` and `pip`; instructions for installing these are specific to your operating system, and beyond the scope of this guide.

### 4. Set Up Your Code Editor

We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for working on this project, but you're welcome to use any editor. The following extensions are **auto-recommended** by VSCode, but here they are again for special instructions, manual installation, or reference.

- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) – Code formatter
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) – JavaScript linter
- [DJLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monosans.djlint) – Handlebars linter/formatter

  - If you used a Python virtual environment to install DJLint, make sure to set the VSCode extension's setting `djlint.pythonPath` to the path to your virtual environment. For example:

    ```bash
    # Windows
    C:/Users/<username>/.virtualenvs/djlint/bin/python

    # Linux
    /home/<username>/.virtualenvs/djlint/bin/python
    ```

- [Markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) – Linter for Markdown
- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) – Honors `.editorconfig` file rules

Once these extensions are installed, your editor should automatically highlight formatting or linting issues.

Your pull request will automatically be checked for linting and formatting via GitHub Actions. If your changes don't pass, they can't be merged (see [Branching and Pull Requests](#branching-commits-and-pull-requests)).

### 5. Set Up a Local Foundry VTT Test Instance

1. We **highly** recommend setting up a separate instance of Foundry from your main installation. This way you are not at risk of breaking things in live worlds.

   - There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to download the NodeJS version of Foundry (make sure to replace `<your-username>` in the following link): `https://foundryvtt.com/community/<your-username>/licenses`
   - Follow the rest of the instructions in [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/B74ZAp3xx3o) to get it up and running (make sure to look at the csomment there by `@Makofueled` because Foundry's folder structure has changed slightly since the video was posted).

2. [Symlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) the cloned system folder to Foundry’s `Data/systems` directory.

   - This is the folder you chose to store your data in the previous step.
   - Otherwise, if you are not using the NodeJS version of Foundry, this directory is likely located at:

     - **Windows**: `%localappdata%/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/`
     - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/`
     - **Linux**: `~/.local/share/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/`

   Symlinking allows developers to choose where to keep our system repos, while also allowing Foundry to see them.

   Example:

   ```bash
   # Mac/Linux
   ln -s /path/to/your/cloned/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system /path/to/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/deltagreen
   ```

   ```bash
   # Windows (Command Prompt, requires admin privileges)
   mklink /D "%localappdata%/FoundryVTT/Data/systems/deltagreen" "%cd%/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system"
   ```

### 6. Start Developing

- Use the developer console (`F12` in most browsers) to inspect logs and debug issues.
- Make changes to code and refresh the browser to see them take effect.

## Branching, Commits, and Pull Requests

Work should always happen on a new branch, i.e., not `master`.

### Branch Naming

Branch names should conform to the following format:

`author-identifier/issue-number/short-description`

The `author-identifier` could be your username, or your first name followed by your last initial, just try to keep it short but identifiable.

Examples:

- `jalenml/420/fix-sanity-rolls`
- `snake-eater/69/add-token-config`
- `tiff123/101/lint-pass`

If there's no GitHub issue yet, you can omit the number:
`author-identifier/short-description` is acceptable. However, it is usually best to make a GitHub issue first to track its progress and leave it open for comment.

### Commit Messages

- Please try to follow [the Seven Rules of a Great Commit Messages](https://gist.github.com/julienbourdeau/e605e4b8b47da97c249a0f72598529c8) as much as possible.
- Slight deviations from the above are okay, but this is what we should be going for.

### Keeping Your Branch Up-To-Date

We prefer a **rebase** workflow to keep history clean and avoid merge commits. If changes have been made to `master` while you've been working:

```bash
git checkout your-branch-name
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```

If you’re new to rebasing, GitLab has a solid primer:
[About Git rebase](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/git_rebase/)

If you run into conflicts, Git will guide you through resolving them. After a successful rebase, you'll need to force-push:

```bash
  git push --force-with-lease
```

```text
⚠️ Never force-push to a shared branch without coordinating with the other contributor(s) to that branch.
```

### Before Opening a Pull Request

Make sure your code is clean and ready:

- ✅ You’ve manually tested your change in a local Foundry world.
- ✅ `npm run lint` shows no errors
- ✅ `npm run format:check` passes
- ✅ Your editor doesn’t show linting/formatting warnings.

We use a GitHub Action to enforce code quality. If your code doesn’t meet the linting and formatting standards, your PR cannot be merged until those checks pass.

Screenshots or gifs are **highly encouraged** for visual/UI changes!

## Testing

### Testing environment

- If you have set up a development environment as described above, `git checkout` the `master` branch or a specific feature/bugfix branch and start testing.
- If you do not want (or don't feel technologically adept enough) to create a full development environment as described above, you can download the most recent build via the following manifest link: <https://deltagreen-foundryvtt.github.io/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/dev/dev-system.json>

### How to test

It is difficult to create a one-size-fits-all procedure for testing, because each issue or feature has its own requirements. However, the steps below attempt to provide a baseline you can follow for most changes. If a PR includes specific test instructions, follow those and then complete the general checks here.

1. Prepare your environment

   - Test in a safe environment (**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED**):
     - We highly recommend [setting up an installation of Foundry separate from your main instance](#5-set-up-a-local-foundry-vtt-test-instance).
     - This way, you are never at risk of breaking anything in your main worlds.
     - If you do not follow the above advice, be aware that opening your main world while you have an in-progress (non-release) version of the system installed **will almost certainly break things in a way that cannot be fixed**. To go back to the release version of the system, uninstall the test build, and reinstall from the in-Foundry system browser.
   - Update to the target build:
     - Development setup: `git checkout` the target branch (or `master` for merged work), then restart Foundry.
     - No dev setup: Install or update the system from the dev manifest: <https://deltagreen-foundryvtt.github.io/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/dev/system.json>
       - **Note**: Testing a **hotfix** branch? Use the hotfix manifest instead: <https://deltagreen-foundryvtt.github.io/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/hotfix/system.json>
   - Use a clean test world:
     - Create a fresh world
       - Note, this is a good practice, but is not always strictly necessary. If you run into anything weird, a completely fresh world is always a good rule-out test.
     - Disable third‑party modules unless:
       - The PR explicitly mentions/involves them.
       - They are extremely common, like Dice So Nice.
     - Launch the world created above.
   - Keep the browser's dev console (F12) open during testing, and note any errors (red text in the console), especially if they arise in response to something you did/tested. Screenshot errors rather than copy/pasting them.

2. Quick test

   - Ensure there are no red errors on load.
   - Create a new Agent (character) and open its sheet. Click through all tabs to ensure they render without errors.
   - Create one of each relevant Item type used by the change (e.g., weapon, armor, equipment) and open their sheets.
   - Open/close sheets, ensure changes to data persist.
   - Refresh the page, ensure changes to data persist.

3. Functional checks by area

   > You only need to test the subsets below which are relevant to the changes you are testing. When unsure or being particularly thorough, do the full pass.

   - Player (non-GM) Perspective Tests

     - Enable the "Hide Sanity from Players" Setting.
     - Make sure Sanity on sheets and in rolls is obscured from players.
     - Enable the "Hide Impossible Landscape content" Setting
     - Make sure the Impossible Landscapes fields on the character sheet are not visible from a player's perspective.

   - Character basics

     - Create an Agent, fill in stats, skills, and add a couple of custom skills, special trainings, bonds, and pieces of equipment.
     - Close, and reopen the sheet; confirm data persists and renders correctly.

   - Rolling and chat cards

     - Roll a few skills (with and without modifiers). Confirm success/failure logic and result styling.
     - Perform a Sanity roll.
     - Perform a Sanity damage roll (Unnatural sheet).
     - Perform a Luck roll.
     - Perform an attack roll from a Weapon.
     - Perform a regular damage roll from a Weapon.
     - Perform a lethality damage roll from a Weapon.
     - Test modifying all above rolls (right-click or shift-click) and ensure the final result matches expectations.

   - Weapons and armor

     - Create a Weapon, add it to the Agent, and roll an attack; verify the damage roll and chat output.
     - Equip armor; confirm that armor stat is calculated and displayed correctly (next to HP).

   - Items and drag/drop

     - Drag items from a compendium and sidebar into the Actor. Ensure sheets open and data is valid.
     - Delete and re-add items to confirm no orphaned data or console errors.

   - Compendia integrity

     - Open compendia (e.g., pregens, equipment) and scan for missing images, broken icons, or malformed data.
     - Drag entries into a world and open them; verify sheets render as expected.
     - If you are actively editing packs, see “[Working with Compendia](#working-with-compendia)” below for FVTT CLI export/extract workflow.

   - System settings

     - Toggle/change each relevant setting to verify it works as expected.
     - Confirm the setting takes effect immediately or after reload, as intended.

   - Localization

     - Switch Foundry’s language to a non-English language, refresh, and re-run a quick UI pass.
     - Confirm no literal keys like “DG.Skills.\*” appear in UI or chat cards, and strings fall back to English where not translated.

   - Layout and styling

     - Look for inconsistent, inaccessible, or just plain ugly visual elements in styling that the system controls.
     - Confirm icons load and are visually consistent.
     - Toggle between Foundry's light and dark modes and check for visual inconsistencies.
     - Change the base font size in Foundry's settings and verify sheets look good enough at various font sizes.

   - Everything else
     - The above are guidelines, but are by no means exhaustive.
     - Go through your regular workflow when actually using the system as a player or GM. Bring your particular perspective.
     - Feel free to also get creative when testing, going beyond what one might expect and noting what you find.

4. Cross-browser sanity (optional but helpful)

   - If possible, quickly verify in one Chromium-based browser (Chrome/Edge) and Firefox.
   - Report any browser-specific issues you encounter.

5. Record your results in a comment on the relevant PR or Issue. You may use the template below directly or as a guide.

   ```text
   Foundry Version: <e.g. 13.347> | DG System Version: <e.g. v1.3.5 or dev>
   Browser/OS: <e.g., Chrome 127 on Windows 11>

   Scope tested:

   Result: Pass / Fail (with summary)
   ```

## Working with Compendia

1. Tell the FVTT CLI that we are working on our delta green package: `fvtt package workon fvtt package workon "deltagreen" --type "System"`
2. To **export** JSON files to a compendium pack: `fvtt package pack "armor" --in "packs/source/armor" --out "packs"`
3. To **extract** a compendium pack to JSON files: `fvtt package pack "armor" --in "packs" --out "packs/source/armor"`
4. Replace `armor` with the name of the compendium pack you are working on.
5. This allows you to make changes to either the JSON files themselves, OR to the in-game compendium packs, whichever makes most sense for the task. It also allows the developers to not have to commit binary LevelDB data to our repo, which is not adviced.

## Localization

We use [Foundry VTT’s built-in localization system](https://foundryvtt.com/article/localization/) to support multiple languages.

### Best Practices

- See this [Foundry VTT Community Wiki article](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/localization/localization-best-practices).

### Where to Add Translations

Localization files live in `lang/` as JSON files. **The `en.json` file is the source of truth.** If you are adding new strings, they must first appear in `en.json`.

To translate, add the matching keys to the appropriate language file (e.g., `fr.json`, `de.json`) with the translated value.

### How to Reference Localized Strings

Do **not** hardcode text directly into HTML or JavaScript. Instead, use localization keys like so:

- **Handlebars**:

  ```handlebars
  {{localize "DG.Skills.accounting"}}
  <!-- Or for string interpolation: -->
  {{localize "DG.FallbackText.newItem" type="TYPES.Item.weapon"}}
  ```

- **JavaScript**:

  ```js
  game.i18n.localize("DG.Skills.accounting");
  // Or for string interpolation:
  game.i18n.format("DG.FallbackText.newItem", {
    type: "TYPES.Item.weapon",
  });
  ```

If you're unsure whether a string should be localized, it probably should be.

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

If you're reporting a bug or requesting a feature:

- Navigate to our [Issues](https://github.com/deltagreen-foundryvtt/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/issues).
- Check that a similar issue has not already been opened. If one has, feel free to add an emoji to indicate that you would like it to be prioritized **OR** leave a comment **_only if_** you have context to add.
- [Choose an appropriate template](https://github.com/deltagreen-foundryvtt/delta-green-foundry-vtt-system/issues/new/choose) and be sure to fill it out. You may delete parts/sections which do not apply.
- Be descriptive. Include screenshots, steps to reproduce, Foundry version, system version, and browser if applicable.
