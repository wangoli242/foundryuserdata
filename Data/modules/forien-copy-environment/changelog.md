# Changelog

## v2.2.4

- Added Polish translation by Lioheart.
- Enabled Italian and French translations.

## v2.2.3

- Made it clearer when modules will not be enabled due to the selected config settings.
  - This is one of the primary use cases of this module, so most of the time it is an accident to uncheck the setting.
  - See [issue #49](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/49).
- Added Italian translation by GregoryWarn.
- Added French translation by rectulo.
- Added machine translations for the new setting strings:
  - German
  - Japanese
  - Portuguese
  - Italian
  - French

## v2.2.2

- Ignore "core.time" and "pf2e.worldClock.worldCreatedOn" values by default.
  - These values can still be selected in from the importer dialog but will be unselected by default.
  - You may run `game.settings.set('forien-copy-environment', 'selected-properties', undefined);` as a script macro to reset the values to their default.
  - See [issue #53](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/53).

## v2.2.1

- v12 compatibility.

## v2.2.0

- Re-added "core.compendiumConfiguration" setting to exports to export Compendium Folder structure mappings.
  - Settings will try to map the folder IDs to the new world's folder IDs based on the compendium key.
  - Added supporting folder data structure to the export.
  - Settings will utilise the supporting folder data structure to re-create the folders where it can.
  - **Important note**: any exports prior to v2.2.0 won't have this support folder data included in the exported file so might not map correctly on the new world. *Please export your world settings again.*
  - See [issue #45](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/45).

## v2.1.9

- Added a module setting to set the maximum number of characters to display when displaying differences.
  - This is to help with the issue where a "maximum call stack size exceeded" error may occur with very large export files (see [issue #43](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/43)).
  - The default is 500 characters per difference.
- Added machine translations for the new setting strings:
  - German
  - Japanese
  - Portuguese

## v2.1.8

- Exclude "core.compendiumConfiguration" setting from exports due to the folder ID mapping not being consistent across worlds anyway.

## v2.1.7

- Mark compatible with v11.
- Append world name to the generated settings file on export.
- Added Portuguese by vithort

## v2.1.6

- Exclude invalid settings from export [#35](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/35)

## v2.1.5

- Allow non-GM users to use the module.
  - Fixes [#32](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/32)
  - Users will see errors for any settings they do not have permission to update.
- Removed deprecated fields in module manifest.
  - Fixes [#33](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/33)

## v2.1.4

- Added timestamp to file export.
  - As requested in [#30](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/30)
- Re-added "Save as JSON" which was removed in v2.1.2 as requested in [#29](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/29)
  - Have renamed this to `Copy as JSON` to help differentiate it from the `Export Settings` option.

## v2.1.3

- Fixed issue where having a player other than GM in the world would prevent the importer from correctly importing anything.

## v2.1.2

* Better handling of config options to make it less likely to break on certain module's configuration settings.
* Added more logging to assist with any future issues.
* Adjust process order to make sure that the server has time to process the updates before the client reloads.
* Removed the `Save as JSON` context menu option as it was rarely the desired action and was confusing (it was not the version that allowed the user to import the settings).

### v2.1.1

  * Importantly, this makes the "Enabled Modules" setting to be correctly saved and imported.

### v2.1.0

* Added compatibility with Foundry VTT v10
* Sorted the settings in the import dialog to make them easier to find.
* Client settings are now correctly exported and imported.
  * Request: [#10](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/10)
* Grouped the settings by their module and collapsed them by default.
  * Request: [#13](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/13)
* Selecting (or unselecting) a setting will now remember that state across imports, saving you time from choosing just the selections you want.
  * Request: [#18](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/issues/18)
