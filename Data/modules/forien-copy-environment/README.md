**NOTE** This is an unofficial forked version of the module maintained by the League of Foundry Developers to provide module continuity while Forien is unavailable.

**[Compatibility]**: *FoundryVTT* 0.6.0 - 12.0+

**[Systems]**: *any*

This module allows for fast copy/save environment data such as core version or list of installed modules and their versions. Supports copying as TXT or saving as JSON.

Module also allows to export (save/backup) current game settings and then import (restore) them. Non-GM users can only import client-side settings.

## Installation

1. Install Forien's Copy Environment using manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundryvtt-forien-copy-environment/master/module.json
2. While loaded in World, enable **_Forien's Copy Environment_** module.

### Usage

Go to Settings tab in Sidebar and **right click** on data **below** "General Information" header

## Features

* Copy Environment (core, system and module versions) to clipboard
* Save Environment (including manifest links) as a JSON file
* Export game settings (both 'world' and 'client' scopes)
* Import game settings ('client' ones, and if you are GM also 'world' ones - you will be able to choose which ones you want to import)

*Please note that importing 'world' scope settings en masse as GM might cause some issues to connected players. I advise players should logout before attempting to import World Settings*

## Info for Module Developers

### How do I opt out?

Perhaps you have a module that you don't want the settings being copied between worlds. You can add the following to your module manifest file to opt out of having the settings copied. The `active` state of your module will still be copied, just the settings won't.

1. Add `noCopyEnvironmentSettings: true` to your manifest json inside of the `flags` field of the manifest.

module.json
```md
  "flags": {
    "noCopyEnvironmentSettings": true
  }
```
