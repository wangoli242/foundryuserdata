# Battle Transitions
Battle Transitions seeks to empower GMs with the ability to configure interesting, dynamic transitions from one scene to another, geared towards reproducing some of the effects that you might see when starting a random battle in your favorite JRPG-style games.

The current list of transition types is somewhat basic, but with the framework in place, this list ease easy to expand as time goes on and I plan to introduce ever more interesting options.

## Installation
You can install this module through the Foundry module installer by searching for "battle transitions", or copying and pasting the manifest URL in the text field at the bottom:
```
https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Battle-Transitions/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

## Examples
For a list of provided effects, please see the [examples wiki page](https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Battle-Transitions/wiki/Examples)

## How does this Work?
Short version: Smoke and Mirrors.

Longer version that actually explains anything:  When triggering a transition, either via command line / macro, the scene navigation context menu, or automatically on scene activation, Battle Transitions first renders a copy of the current scene and creates an overlay placed on top of Foundry's normal canvas.  The module then activates the next scene, and applies a series of PIXI filters on the overlay image to allow for effects that reveal the new scene in some interesting way.  These effects generally use GLSL shaders, which allows for a great deal of freedom when designing them.

## What About [Some Effect Here]?
I do have a short list of effects from some classic JRPG titles (mostly Final Fantasy, honestly) that I'm looking at incorporating, but am very open to implementing requests from the module's users.

If you'd like to request some particular effect, please [open a github issue](https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Battle-Transitions/issues/new) and describe the effect you would like to see.  If you're looking to reproduce an effect from an existing game, please provide a sample video of the effect in action to better illustrate just how it ought to look.

## Known Issues / Compatibility With Other Modules
- Compatibility with [Scene Transitions](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/scene-transitions/) - Currently, no specific measures are taken to ensure compatibility with Scene Transitions or any other modules that affect Foundry's behavior when changing scenes, but preliminary testing shows that the two modules can be used side-by-side if you take some care with how you configure the timing of your Battle Transition sequence.
- [Theatre Inserts](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/theatre) - Actor inserts are displayed over a Battle Transition, which is the most likely desired behavior.  This is unlikely to be changed in the future, as Theatre Inserts uses HTML elements for its dialogue boxes, and canvas effects cannot be displayed above HTML elements.

For a list of known bugs and feature requests, please see the project's [issues page](https://github.com/Unarekin/FoundryVTT-Battle-Transitions/issues)
