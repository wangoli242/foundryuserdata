# Infection

[← Back to the README](../index.md)

Infection is a damage type from [HORUS: Thy Hubris Manifest](https://cornylius.itch.io/thy-hubris-manifest) (by P.B. Cornylius), a heat-based cousin of Burn. Lancer Automations adds it, with an end-of-turn check and sheet tracking.

## How it works

<img align="right" src="../img/inf-check.png" width="45%"/>

Taking infection deals **Heat equal to the infection value** straight away, and stacks if the target already has some.

At the end of its turn the token rolls a **Systems check**: on a success all infection clears, on a failure it takes Heat equal to its current infection.

Anything that clears Burn, **Stabilize** or a **Full Repair**, clears infection too.

## Dealing it

<img align="right" src="../img/inf-card.png" width="45%"/>

**Infection** is a weapon damage type alongside Kinetic, Energy, and the rest. Infection resistance halves it, though the Heat it deals can't be resisted.

When an attack deals it, the damage card shows the infection amount with **Apply Heat** and **Undo** buttons.

## On the sheet

<img align="right" src="../img/inf-sheet.png" width="45%"/>

An **Infection** card sits next to Burn on the sheet, with a value field and a button to roll the end-of-turn check by hand.

Infection is tracked on the actor, available as a token resource-bar option in the Token Config Resources tab.
