# Wrecks

[← Back to the README](../index.md)

When a token dies, the module leaves a wreck where it stood. Per category and per token you set what it is (token or flat tile), whether it blocks the field, and how it looks and sounds. Wrecks can be resurrected back into the original.

## On death

When a token's structure hits 0, the module drops its wreck in place and clears the original. The dead token leaves the combat tracker (**`enableRemoveFromCombat`**), and a destroyed squad is marked **MIA** (**`squadLostOnDeath`**).

## Per-category behaviour

The dead token is sorted into an auto-detected category, **Mech**, **Human / Pilot / Squad**, **Monstrosity**, or **Biological**. Each one's wreck can be a **Token** (a wreck actor with its own HP), a flat **Tile**, or **Skip**ped, set in the per-category table along with its on-wreck terrain.

---

## Wreck terrain

A wreck can leave something on its footprint: **THT difficult terrain** (needs Terrain Height Tools, painting the type set by **`wreckTerrainType`**) or a **movement +1 aura** (needs the GAA fork). It's set per category, so mech hulls can clog the field while corpses don't.

## Per-token config

<img align="right" src="../img/wr-token-config.png" width="45%"/>

A single token can override its category in the Token Config **L.A** tab: its wreck mode and terrain, a custom wreck image, effect, and sound, the tile scale, and whether the image, sound, and effect play at all.

## Resurrect

Wreck **tiles** get a **Resurrect** button in their token HUD that brings the original token back, fully restored, and deletes the tile. Token wrecks are resurrected from a macro or the API.

---

## FX & sound

The explosion animation and sound are **`enableWreckAnimation`** and **`enableWreckAudio`**, with **`wreckMasterVolume`** over the top and **`disableHumanDeathSound`** to keep corpses quiet.

---

## Custom wreck assets

**`wreckAssetsPath`** points the system at a folder of your own wreck images, effects, and sounds. Left blank, it falls back to `modules/lancer-automations/wrecks`. Lay the folder out like this:

```
<wreckAssetsPath>/
├── s1/                 # wreck images for size-1 tokens
│   ├── mech/
│   ├── human/
│   ├── squad/
│   ├── monstrosity/
│   └── biological/
├── s2/                 # size-2 tokens (same five subfolders)
├── s3/                 # size-3 tokens (same five subfolders)
├── effects/            # explosion animations
│   ├── mech/
│   ├── human/
│   ├── squad/
│   ├── monstrosity/
│   └── biological/
└── audio/              # explosion sounds
    ├── mech/
    ├── human/
    ├── squad/
    ├── monstrosity/
    └── biological/
```

On a wreck, the module picks a random file from the folder that matches the token's category (and size, for images). Empty folders fall back, squad → human → biological, monstrosity → biological, and mech images fall back to the bare `#!js s{size}` folder.

A per-token image, effect, or sound set in the Token Config L.A tab overrides all of it.
