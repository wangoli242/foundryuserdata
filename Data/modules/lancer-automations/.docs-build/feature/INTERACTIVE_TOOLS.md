# Interactive Tools

[← Back to the README](../index.md) · API: [API_INTERACTIVE.md](../API_INTERACTIVE.md)

Cards that ask players to choose or vote, and on-canvas tools to pick, place, and move tokens and zones. Automations and macros call these. The function signatures are in [API_INTERACTIVE.md](../API_INTERACTIVE.md).

---

## Choice cards

<img align="right" src="../img/it-choice-card.png" width="45%"/>

A choice card pauses and waits for a player to pick. `startChoiceCard` has four modes:

- **OR** - pick one option, the card closes.
- **AND** - every option must be clicked. Each runs as soon as it's confirmed.
- **Vote** and **Hidden Vote** - the card is broadcast to its recipients. You watch a live tally and click **Confirm** to resolve (hidden keeps votes secret until then, ties are broken by you).

**`userIdControl`** routes a card to one player or a list (first to respond wins). A non-interactive **waiting card** (`startWaitCard`) shows "waiting for X" in the meantime.

**openChoiceMenu** builds and sends a choice or vote card from a dialog, no code needed.

## Card and flow stacking

<img align="right" src="../img/it-stacking.png" width="45%"/>

Lancer shows one roll card at a time, and so do these. When several fire at once (an area attack hitting five tokens, or a pile of reactions), they queue instead of overwriting each other, including **attack, damage, and stat-roll** cards and the interactive cards above. A badge on the active card counts how many are still queued.

## Picking targets and areas

<img align="right" src="../img/it-target-picker.png" width="45%"/>

**chooseToken** highlights the valid tokens in range and asks you to pick one or more, with an optional **filter** (allies only, for example).

For area effects it switches to **blast / cone / line / burst**: place the shape on the canvas, **Ctrl+wheel** to rotate, and toggle **elevation-aware**, **auto-elevation**, and **propagation** (flood-fill that terrain blocks).

**pickSingleTargetToggle** skips the card: click a token to toggle it as your target.

<br clear="right"/>

## HASE contest

<img align="right" src="../img/it-contest.png" width="45%"/>

**openHaseContestCard** sets up a contest between two tokens: pick each contender and its HASE stat, roll both sides, and compare. It's reachable from a token's **Contest** entry under Skills, and Search, Jockey, Grapple, and Break Free all run through it.

<br clear="right"/>

---

## Force check

<img align="right" src="../vid/it-forcecheck.gif" width="45%"/>

**openForceCheckCard** sends a HASE check to a batch of tokens: pick the skill, pick the targets like an attack roll, and each token's owner rolls it themselves. Give it a save-vs token and every check becomes a save against that actor's SAVE, pre-targeted in the roller's HUD. It's reachable from a token's **Force Check** entry under Skills.

<br clear="right"/>

## Placing zones

<img align="right" src="../img/it-zone.png" width="45%"/>

**placeZone** drops Blast / Burst / Cone / Line zones (through TemplateMacro). A zone can apply **status effects** to anyone inside, deal damage as a **dangerous zone**, or mark **difficult terrain** for the [ruler](./MOVEMENT.md). A zone can also follow a token.

For one-off effects you can skip the API: place a template by hand and attach the behaviour to it with [TemplateMacro](https://github.com/Agraael/templatemacro).

<br clear="right"/>

## Moving and knocking back tokens

<img align="right" src="../img/it-knockback.png" width="45%"/>

**knockBackToken** pushes or pulls tokens a set distance, one at a time, snapping to the grid and respecting obstacles. The **Knockback** checkbox in the damage dialog reads a weapon's Knockback tag and runs this after damage.

**placeToken** drops tokens at grid-snapped spots, and **moveToken** moves or teleports a token while drawing a trace from start to destination. The move, knockback, and teleport pickers take **Shift+click** waypoints for multi-leg paths.

<br clear="right"/>

## Targeting in attack and check flows

<img align="right" src="../img/it-attack-target.png" width="45%"/>

The attack HUD's target and area buttons are covered in [Advanced Targeting and Measurement](./ATTACK_TARGETING.md#the-targeting-buttons). Two related settings:

- **Target on a check** - with **`statRollTargeting`** on, a stat or skill roll (HULL / AGI / SYS / ENG) gets the same target button as an attack, using the picked token's save or matching stat as the difficulty.
- **Range on the attack card** - **`rangePreviewOnAttackCard`** shows the attacker's reach on the canvas when the attack card opens, following the **Thrown** box for a thrown weapon.

<br clear="right"/>

## Colors

<img align="right" src="../img/it-colors.png" width="45%"/>

The **Colors** settings tab lets each player recolor the targeting and range-glow palette, with a button to reset them.

<br clear="right"/>

## Deployables

<img align="right" src="../img/it-deploy.png" width="45%"/>

- **Place a deployable** - drop a drone, turret, or other deployable on the field (drones default to sensor range), and recall it when done. A deploy menu lists an actor's deployables.
- **Throw a weapon** - place a thrown weapon as a token on the ground (it's disabled in the sheet while it's out there) and pick it back up later.
- **Hard cover** - spawn a hard-cover token whose HP scales with its size.
- **Extra deployables** - attach extra deployables to an item that doesn't natively carry one.

<br clear="right"/>

<img align="right" src="../img/it-deploy-lines.png" width="45%"/>

With **`linkManualDeploy`**, a deployable you drag onto the scene yourself links to your token and fires its `onDeploy`, like the deploy menu does. **`showDeployableLines`** draws a line from an owner to its deployables on hover.

Delayed appearance / reinforcement is in [GAMEPLAY_AUTOMATION.md](./GAMEPLAY_AUTOMATION.md).

<br clear="right"/>

## Add Extra

<img align="right" src="../img/it-extras.png" width="45%"/>

**Add Extra** attaches **custom actions** (activation type, plus charges, recharge, and limited / per-turn / per-round uses) and **extra deployables** to an actor, no code needed. It works on a token's actor, on the prototype actor, or directly on an **item** - and only lists the entries you create here.

Open it from the **Add Extra** button on the actor or item sheet header, or from **TAH > Utility > Misc > Add Extra**. Anything attached to an item is stored on the item and follows it: whoever carries it gets the extras.

## Overlap token picker

<img align="right" src="../img/it-overlap-picker.png" width="45%"/>

With **`overlapTokenPicker`** on, clicking a spot where tokens are stacked shows a small picker so you choose which one.

<br clear="right"/>

## Share Interactive Tools

With **`displayToolsToOthers`** on (the default), your in-progress tools, target picking, zone/token placement, and movement traces show to other players as a faded ghost of the same shapes, so the table can follow what you're aiming at. A hidden caster or hidden tokens are never broadcast.
