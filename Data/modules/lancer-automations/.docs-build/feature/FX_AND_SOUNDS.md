# FX and Sounds

[← Back to the README](../index.md)

The cosmetic and feedback layer: visual effects on statuses, animations when actions fire, and sounds for most table events. All optional.

The **Statuses & FX** tab for the visuals, and the **Sounds** tab for audio.

## Status effect visuals

<img align="right" src="../img/fs-status-fx.png" width="45%"/>

Each status gets a Token Magic FX overlay (Token Magic FX must be installed), applied and cleared with the status itself:

- a danger-zone glow
- a burn shimmer
- an overshield outline
- chains for immobilized
- film grain for stunned, and so on

Every one has its own toggle under **Visual effects**, all under a single master switch.

**Low-quality mode** swaps the heaviest effects, Danger Zone, Core Power, and Jammed, for cheap outline versions. The glow and bloom filters they normally use are GPU-hungry.

**Remove statuses on death** clears a token's statuses when its structure hits 0.

## Auto-status icons

Some statuses are applied straight from the actor's numbers: the danger-zone overlay at heat ≥ 50%, plus burn, overshield, infection, and cascading whenever those values rise above zero. Each has its own toggle under **Auto-status icons**.

## Guardian / Bulwark aura

<img align="right" src="../img/fs-guardian.png" width="45%"/>

A soft aura is drawn around tokens with **Guardian** or **Bulwark**. **`guardianBulwarkAuraMode`** sets it to always on, combat-only, or off. Combat-only needs the GAA fork.

## Action FX

<img align="right" src="../img/fs-action-fx.png" width="45%"/>

When an action runs, a matching animation plays through Sequencer:

- a slash on a skirmish
- a downdraft on boost
- an impact on ram
- smoke on hide, and so on

Toggle the lot with **Enable Action FX**. They need both Sequencer and Lancer Weapon FX installed. Without either, they're skipped.

## Damage feedback

<p align="center">
  <video src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Agraael/lancer-automations/main/doc/vid/fs-damage-feedback.mp4" controls muted loop width="70%"></video>
</p>

Applying damage plays an impact sprite and sound on the target per damage type: one impact per 3 damage inflicted, staggered, each at a random spot on the token.

Armor-absorbed damage plays a clank instead, and overshield hits have their own impact.

---

## JB2A free-pack fallback

Many of the action animations use JB2A. If you only have the free pack, the module substitutes free-pack equivalents (tinting them to match) so the effects still play instead of erroring on a missing asset.

**`debugForceJb2aFree`** forces that path even when the Patreon pack is installed.

---

## Sounds

<img align="right" src="../img/fs-sounds.png" width="45%"/>

Most things at the table make a sound:

- HUD clicks
- token hover, select and target
- damage by type
- stat changes
- action FX
- wreck explosions

Each family has a master volume, and every event inside it can be muted on its own, click a toggle to preview it.
