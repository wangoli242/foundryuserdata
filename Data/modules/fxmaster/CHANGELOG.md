## [v8.3.3] - 2026-07-27
- Resolved a bug where some Particle parameters would not display

## [v8.3.2] - 2026-07-27
Welcome to FXMaster V8.3.0! This is an incredibly exciting update with some features I've been working on for a while that enhance the natural feel of effects on canvas. Many effects now have either a Background mode, Token Trails mode, or both! These options can really spice up your environmental effects with persistent time-based background fills, and token trails that interact with various particles and filters! The Wind and Duststorm effects for FXMaster+ also get some exciting updates that allow tying particle effects direction into the wind direction, and the ability to paint Wind areas to allow defining trees, bushes, etc that should be effected by wind displacement/movement. Tons of other small tweaks all over the place
- Added Background mode to FXMaster effects Snow, Snowstorm, Rain, and Autumn Leaves. Added background mode to FXMaster+ effects Summer Leaves, Sakura Bloom, Duststorm, and Sandstorm
  - Background mode contains a number of parameters including fill over time or fixed background density. Fill over time will allow setting a time to fill which will cause the background to organically introduce the effect in the background over time.
- Added Token Interactivity to FXMaster effects Fog, Snow, Snowstorm, Rain, Autumn Leaves, Bubbles, Rats, and Spiders. Added Token Interactivity to FXMaster+ effects Water, Sakura Bloom, Duststorm, Sandstorm, Fish, Fireflies, and custom user particle effects
  - Token Interactivity covers a number of different interactions including bubbles popping, leaves flying into the air as a token walks through them, paths created in snowy areas, and more!
- Added Tooltip compass nomenclature readout for effects with a Direction parameter. This will update in real time to display N/E/S/etc depending on the degrees set.
- Added tint parameter to the Lightning effect
- Added direction parameter to the Fog filter effect, allows further customization for fog which was a bit limited.
- Updated Rain effect. Rain now uses a procedural shader rather than dedicated particle sprites. This should improve performance especially on larger scenes and looks better imo
- Updated Snowstorm effect. Snowstorm now uses a procedural shader rather than dedicated particle sprites. This should improve performance especially on larger scenes and definitely looks better. Snowstorm also receives a sweeping snow effect when the background is turned on that can emulate a heavy snowstorm really well.
- Updated and improved V14 levels logic by converting some bespoke FXMaster code to use Foundrys native detection handling
- Updated Detach Window handling in V14 to fix a few bugs and remove empty deadspace
- Removed the FXMaster compendium pack. The macro examples there were outdated, macros can be saved and inspected by generating them directly from the Save Particle and Filter Effects as Macro controls button
- Resolved V14 levels issue where multiple levels with a suppression behavior would not properly suppress in certain levels scenarios.
- Resolved regions not normalizing fxmaster parameter values properly at runtime
- Resolved isometric modules causing FXMaster scene effects to not apply properly

## [v8.2.4] - 2026-06-23
- Secondary update to the scene flag-wipe bug to prevent un-migrated scenes from being effected. Make sure to update to this version if on a build between 8.2.0 - 8.2.3

## [v8.2.3] - 2026-06-20
- Resolved a nasty bug that would wipe all scene flags instead of only the FXMaster scene flags that needed normalization migration.
- Updated rain splashes to use a small delta in size ranges so that the splashes feel more natural.

## [v8.2.2] - 2026-06-20
- Resolved a nasty bug that would wipe all scene flags instead of only the FXMaster scene flags that needed normalization migration
- Updated rain splashes to use a small delta in size ranges so that the splashes feel more natural

## [v8.2.1] - 2026-06-20
- Added new animated spritesheets for the Rain particle's rain drops option. On top of being animated, rain drops also now have a dedicated top-down version while in top-down mode along with a side-view version
- Updated pt-br localizations, thanks Kharmans!
- Resolved region initialization issue in the SWADE system that prevented a world from starting while fxmaster was active

## [v8.2.0] - 2026-06-19
Welcome to FXMaster V8.2.0!
- Added new core filter effect, Screen Shake! This has a persistent or timed mode, along with an audio aware mode to allow activating based on audio bass level for things like integrating cleanly with Lightning if desired.
- Added new Orbit mode to all Animal particles, along with Bubbles, Embers, Autumn Leaves, and Stars. This mode rotates the particles in a band around the center point of the scene or the region container with modifiable distance from center. Should allow some fun implementations for things like crows circling a battlefield or birds circling a seaside port.
- Added new setting to allow playing effects over Fog of War/Token Vision. This is a request I've received a few times to allow effect visibility when players cannot see the area the effect is taking place in.
- Added new api's for stopping all scene level effects on a scene, stopping all region level effects on a scene, and starting all regions level effects on a scene
- Added right click option to the Clear Particle and Filter Effects button which will disable all region particle and filter effects for a given scene. This will not delete the behaviors.
- Added new splash parameter to the presets api to allow turning Rain's splash option on/off
- Updated compatability with V14 regions so that fxmaster effects respect Foundrys Wall Restrictions optionals
- Updated effect direction normalization. Took a pass at modifying the direction parameter for all effects to respect geometric definitions. 0 should face right on the x-axis for all effects, with the angle increasing counterclockwise.
- Updated effect normalization for many parameters to provide a 0-1 range instead of the arbitrary numeric values previously used in various places. This should be more consistent from a usability standpoint as non-numeric specific effects now effectively act on a 0-100% scale.
- Updated Crows, Birds, and Eagles particle effects to have a higher cap for max density
- Update Spiders particle effect to have a lower available minimum density
- Updated Lightning, Lightning Bolt, and Screen Shake filter effects audio aware api parameter name from 'Thunder Aware' to 'Audio Aware' for more clarity. Tooltip now contains a reference to Thunder audio being a common use case for this parameter.
- Resolved mask placement issue when Restricts Weather or FXMaster Restricts Particle/Filter was enabled for an overhead Tile with a mode other than Fade Entire Tile.
- Resolved Embers, Stars, Fireflies, and Magic Crystals particle effects not displaying over top of Foundry darkness. When those effects are active in a scene with darkness, they will play outside of FXMaster's layers constructor and so will not be order-able against other effects - playing on top by default.
- Resolved filter effects not fully displaying if a scene did not have a background applied.
- Added localizations for the new Orbit mode and the new FXMaster+ Fire particle and filter effects!

## [v8.1.4] - 2026-06-01
- Resolved an edge case bug where a region with no shape data could cause a scene crash under certain circumstances

## [v8.1.3] - 2026-05-31
- Resolved token vision becoming black and white while effects were active

## [v8.1.2] - 2026-05-30
- Resolved effects appearing over-top of Foundry Darkness, and in concert resolved some mask sliding inconcistencies surrounding Adjust Darkness Level behaviors
- Tweaked and improved some scene hooks and compositor behavior to improve performance and frame time consistency
- Updated pt-br localizations, thanks Kharmans!

## [v8.1.1] - 2026-05-24
Welcome to FXMaster V8.1! I highly recommend updating to this version if you previously updated to FXMaster V8.0. Many improvements and bugfixes were implemented in relation to FXMaster's new layers compositor that should resolve a number of performance regressions and visual oddities on canvas.
- Many many... many tweaks to the new V8 compositor for effects, specifically around improving performance and frame-time consistency
- Added two new parameters to the Tiles Overhead menu. The new parameters are 'FXMaster: Restricts Particles' and 'FXMaster: Restricts Filters'. These can be used to restrict either particles or filters, while the native 'Restricts Weather' option can still be used to restrict both.
- Added new functionality to the FXMaster Layers menu. Suppression regions are now included in the layers menu and can be ordered against scene effects to determine if an effect is suppressed by a given region or not.
- Added new FXMaster setting 'Include Foundry Grid in FX Stack'. This option will allow particles and filters to play overtop of the grid (if enabled) without interfering with other Interface level components. This setting is disabled by default to mirror how FXMaster currently functions, but I recommend enabling it for more realistic looking effects if you play with a grid.
- Added new FXMaster setting 'Apply Region Behaviors to Overhead Levels'. This option will display region suppression or addition behaviors realistically, ex: A suppression region on Level 2 will display that suppression while the user is on Level 1 and hovers to view the 2nd level. This can have a large impact on performance so it is defaulted off, if you would like to enable it make sure to test thoroughly before using it in live play.
- Removed FXMaster setting 'Reset Particle and Filter Parameters'. This setting would not always act in a straightforward way from the users perspective. It has instead been replaced by:
- Added right click menu for particle and filter effects toggle buttons. Right clicking will now allow you to reset individual effects to their default settings on a per-scene basis.
- Added new Shadow parameter options to the Bats, Birds, Crows, and Eagles particle effects. These options are functionally equivalent to the Clouds shadow option and allow additional flexibility for birds to cast shadows
- Updated region behaviors to modify effects in real-time when making adjustments. This means enabling effects, modifying parameters, etc will be viewable on screen as adjustments are made. Saving the region will confirm these updates while hitting close window will cancel them. This should allow tweaking region effects MUCH easier compared to previous versions
- Added localizations for FXMaster+ Aurora Borealis and some new functionality
- Re-added the small specials layer removed in V8.0. At least one module was using it which was one more than I was aware of
- Bugfix for the Old Film filter not updating parameters properly
- Bugfix for scene Particles not applying properly to Levels when individual levels were selected

## [v8.0.5] - 2026-04-26
- Bugfix for Region behaviors elevation constraints not working to hide particle or filter Effects
- Bugfix for Foundry's native Suppress Weather handling not always covering all regions if multiple regions with the behavior were present
- Updated the FXMaster Tools button to FXMaster Tools Overview. This is now a clickable button and opens an overview window of the various functionality you can expect in FXMaster (and FXMaster+ if present). Also contains video popouts for specific examples on how to accomplish some common tasks in FXMaster.

## [v8.0.4] - 2026-04-26

- Bugfix for V13 where certain Particle Effects would render with a full white overlay

## [v8.0.0] - 2026-04-25
Welcome to FXMaster V8.0.0! This can be considered the full release for Foundry V14. A few things to note, as noted the Animation Effects functionality in FXMaster has been removed in this build. Additionally, support for V12 has been removed, FXMaster now contains compatability for V13+.
- Complete revamp for V14's Levels. Filters and Particles can be placed on specific levels for a scene with a new Scene multi-select. Regions now also respect multi-level placement for effects, and region suppression can be applied to specific levels. This update should allow a ton of flexibility when setting up your scenes, hope everyone enjoys!
- Complete revamp of Particle and Filter layering. There is now a dedicated 'Manage Layers' button in FXMaster controls that allows placing particles and filters above or beneath other particles and filters for Scene, Region, and API effects
- Added new API under FXMASTER.api.effects. Newly created macros in V8 will use this API. It accepts play, stop, and toggle along with a Skip Fading parameter if you wish to create the macro effects without a fade in/fade out for additional api flexibility.
- Added a new dialog when saving macros on a scene. This dialog allows you to name the macro, and toggle optionals for a Play or Toggle macro as well as Skip Fading true/false parameter
- Improved Manage API Effects window with additional detail for whether the API is a preset or effect type. Also includes the Macro name if present to easily identify different particle/filter sets
- Added new Below Tiles parameter for both Particles and Filters. This will cause Particle or Filter effects to not apply overtop of Tiles on a map. If the Tile is set as an overhead with occlusion, the effect will display beneath the Tile unless the Tiles Restricts Weather option is enabled.
- Added new Below Foreground parameter for both Particles and Filters. This will cause Particle or Filter effects to not apply to the Foreground of a Scene or Level.
- Added new Darkness Activation parameter to allow playing Particle or Filter effects only within a specified darkness range.
- Tiles 'Restricts Weather' parameter now suppresses Filters when beneath the tile elevation, previously only supported Particles.
- New presets API parameters for belowTiles, belowForeground, darknessActivationEnabled, darknessActivationMin, darknessActivationMax, and levels
- Fix range sliders moving with mouse scrollwheel while not focused in V14 and some other oddities
- Added Blend mode to Color filter (Normal, Multiply, Color Burn, Darken, etc)
- Reduced Fog Filters max brightness blend
- Updated Tooltips to also display when hovering parameter tooltips, instead of only on the parameters themselves
- Resolved power icon css placement issues in V14

## [v7.5.2] - 2026-04-01
- Official compatability with V14! (It was already compatible, but now with extra compatability)
- Resolved Hail, Rain, and Snow Particle Effects not generating in regions correctly due to the wrong origin spawn
- Updated pt-br localizations, thanks Kharmans!
- Updated pl localizations, thanks Lioheart!

## [v7.5.1] - 2026-03-30
- Resolved a few missing localizations

## [v7.5.0] - 2026-03-30
Welcome to FXMaster's 7.5 release! This release brings some updates to the masking pipeline to continue my V7+ efforts of allowing more naturalistic effects
- Added new Edge Fade % parameter for Particle Region Behaviors! This is a region level option instead of Filters region per-effect level option, so any particle on a given region will receive the Edge Fade % parameter when set. This should allow for more realistic particles within a region shape, especially larger particles like clouds and fog (although smaller particles benefit as well).
- Added new Edge Fade % parameter for both Particle and Filter Suppression regions. This functionality allows for scene level effects to blend into suppression regions, removing the hard edge cutoff in previous versions.
- New localizations for March' FXMaster+ effect, Water!
- Updated Presets API. Set hail slightly smaller, and increased the duration between lightning flashes for Thunderstorm
- Re-organized utils and hooks and squashed a few small bugs
- Resolved missing InQuad ease function
- Hardened masking generally to avoid masks disconnecting from the canvas when many overlapping regions with the same particle/filter effects were present

## [v7.4.2] - 2026-02-27
- Added new Presets API parameters for additional flexibility. New parameters are Speed, Density, and Color. Speed and Density are best effort approaches, the percentage increase/decrease acts against the medium (default value) for a given preset, if that value is already at min/max for a given preset, there will be no change. Similarly if already close to min/max, low and very low may both display the same because they both reach the absolute minimum/maximum value.
  - Speed: One of very-low (-100%), low (-50%), medium, high (+50%), very-high (+100%) - Default medium.
  - Density: One of very-low (-100%), low (-50%), medium, high (+50%), very-high (+100%) - Default medium.
  - Color: Hex color code, will override and activate a given tint/color parameter when present

## [v7.4.1] - 2026-02-23
- Updated Presets after a full pass. Many effects have had a reduction to their opacity to make tokens more visible on canvas. Many other adjustments as well
- Added the ability to minimize the Animation Effects window warning noting that it will be removed in V14.
- Merged pt-br localizations, thanks Kharmans!

## [v7.4.0] - 2026-02-22
Welcome to Gambit's FXMaster V7.4.0! Following hot on the heels of 7.3, this release brings a new presets api for module integrations which starts with an official integration with the excellent Calendaria module by Tyler! Additionally, this release brings a bunch of things to get FXMaster ready for Foundry V14 on day 1.
- Added new api FXMASTER.api.presets. Use FXMASTER.api.presets.list() for a list of all pre-built effects!
- Added API Manager Edit button & window. This allows editing an api effect while it is in progress in a single instance editor window. Should allow even more flexibility when dealing with API ran effects.
- Added integration pieces for fxmaster-plus' new Sound Effects Manager which ties sounds into particle or filter effect activation/deactivation within a scene or region
- Added localization keys for the new FXMaster+ SoundFX toggles and Sound Effects Manager
- Added localization keys for the new FXMaster+ Filter Effect Lightning Bolt
- Added new free Particle Effect to celebrate the collaboration with Calendaria! The new effect is Hail.
- Updated FXMaster version max to v14. This is primarily for anyone who wants to test Foundrys pre-release V14 builds, I think FXMaster is in a good enough spot for testing at this point.
- Updated special key handling for V14 to resolve deprecation warnings
- Updated Region behaviors to accept new region shapes present in V14
- Updated Region Edge Fade % behavior. This behavior is now much more consistent and should cover all region shapes and multi-shape situations. When a simple shape is present FXMaster uses a polygon-edge fast path for fade, falling back to SDF rendering for more complex shapes. The idea is to allow fast updates for moving regions if a user decides to attach a region to a token with an FXMaster effect present, which should typically be a simple circle/squircle/rectangle
- Updated the static placeholder FXMaster Controls icon from a power button FA icon to an Informational I FA icon, and changed the text to FXMaster Tools
- TBD: V14 Levels integration. At the moment it appears FXMaster mostly just works with V14 levels, I'll be waiting for future pre-release builds to fully verify that functionality.
- Resolved player permission errors when a GM modified FXMaster region behaviors while a player was logged in (Thank yous to Michael)

## [v7.3.0] - 2026-01-29
Welcome to Gambit's FXMaster V7.3.0! This release brings some fun and functional usability enhancements to Particle Effects.
- Added new API Effects controls button to FXMaster. This button will open a window where you can manage active api effects for a given scene. 
- Added conditional visibility for relevant toggle on/off style parameters. Ex: When Directional Movement is off, the direction and spread parameters will not be visible. They become visible if that option is toggled on. This should make it clearer which parameters actually have an effect in a given mode.
- Added a new title bar menu item 'Hide Effects' to both the Particle Effects Management and Filter Effects Management windows. This option will open a list of current effects from FXMaster or FXMaster+ and allow them to be hidden from the management windows. This option should help to reduce clutter in instances where a given effect is not relevant for your campaign, especially for FXMaster+ users as the effects list continues to grow
- Added localization keys for the new top down mode, directional movement mode, and lateral movement pieces, as well as the Hide Effects menu. Additional keys also added for the new FXMaster+ Glitch and Fish effects
- Updated the Controls button localization label to FXMaster Controls from Effect Controls to make it clearer the tab is related to FXMaster
- Updated a number of Particle Effects to give them a Top Down mode: Bubbles, Embers, Leaves, Snow, and Snowstorm in FXMaster, and Sakura Bloom plus the Directional Drift custom user template in FXMaster+
- Updated Animals Particle Effects to give them an optional Directional Movement parameter. When enabled, all animals particles will move in the same specified direction, with an optional spread parameter to determine how much movement in that direction deviates.
- Updated Animals Particle Effects to give them an optional Lateral Movement parameter. This option causes the particles to move in a randomized sine wave pattern and should enable more naturalistic movement.
- Updated Top Down to be a toggleable parameter in the Rain effect and removed the separate Rain Top Down effect - no longer needed with the toggleable parameter
- Resolved Color Picker not changing color when closing the color picker selector which made a toggle of the effect necessary to change colors. Foundrys native color picker was implemented in 7.2.0 for consistency, but it is more restrictive so live updates to colors while the color picker window is open are no longer possible.
- Resolved a visual jump issue that could occur in the Filter Effects window when toggling certain parameters
- Resolved multi-select inconsistently updating parameters for effects that were on, which often required a toggle of the effect to apply

## [v7.2.2] - 2026-01-05
- Made a few adjustments to reduce minimum density for Spiders particle effect
- Resolved User-made Particle Effects from FXMaster+ not sorting alphabetically in the Particle Effects Management window
- Added a few integration pieces for my upcoming Gambit's Lounge module Gambit's Image Viewer, which will add functionality enabling Particle Effects in an Image Popout window.
- Added a note to the Animation Effects window to indicate it will be removed in the V14 release

## [v7.2.1] - 2025-12-20
- A number of fixes to masks, including some important changes to prevent losing webgl context
- Updated pt-br localization, thanks Kharmans!

## [v7.2.0] - 2025-12-17
- Welcome to FXMaster V7.2! This release focused on performance and consistency improvements for Particle Effects, accomplished in a couple of ways:
  - First, all particle effects have had a pass on their density parameter with more normalized density ranges they can generate Particle effects within. This should prevent issues where you could apply an effect with maximum density on a huge scene and crash it (tested on scenes up to about 16000x12000). Density will now normalize to the number of cells present on a scene. I've tested each of these individually to try to find a good balance between performance and density, happy to hear any feedback (preferably on my Gambit's Lounge Discord) as these can be adjusted further in the future. 
  - Second, I've added in support for Foundrys built-in Performance Mode client setting. FXMaster will now adjust density based on that setting, where percentage is the fraction of total particles set in the manager that will be emitted, Maximum = 100%, High = 75%, Medium = 50%, Low = 25%. This should be a big help for players and GM's on lower end hardware such as laptops, and keep GM's from having to globally reduce particle density in order to not kill their lowest end hardware.
- Added new Elevation Constraints option to 'FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles' and 'FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters' behaviors. This functions in the same way as the region behaviors for adding a particle or filter, and will allow suppression based on the parameters set.
- Backend cleanup for Filter and Particle Effects, resolved a number of issues with masking consistency including Dynamic Token Borders not being masked appropriately when belowTokens = true
- Switched Particle and Filter management apps to use default foundry color picker for Tint parameter, only difference is a hex code text input is present for easy copy/paste
- Upodated Particle and Filter management apps to allow using the mouse scroll wheel to increase/decrease parameter values while a range slider is selected. This should be a good middle ground between preventing accidentally changing a parameter and allowing the flexibility of the mousewheel.
- Fog Filter Effect: Updated defaults to work better visually for a standard Fog, renamed Density label to Opacity as that is functionally what the setting does.
- Underwater Filter Effect: Resolved shader crashing in certain scenarios
- Added new localizations for December's FXMaster+ release, Ice! Also added new localizations for FXMaster+'s holiday surprise :]

## [v7.1.4] - 2025-11-26

## [v7.1.1] - 2025-11-22
- Resolved Animation Effects bug that prevented the window from opening if animations db was built but no animations were present
- Resolved missing gate for the belowTokens option on Particle Effects that caused a significant performance drop when a large number of tokens are on the canvas, even with belowTokens off. Additionally, improved performance of the belowTokens option when on for Particle Effects especially in many tokens on scene scenarios.

## [v7.1.0] - 2025-11-16
This 7.1 release covers many bugfixes for 7.0, some performance improvements, and visual enhancements for the Particle, Filter, and Animation Effect windows
- Particle & Filter Effects:
  - Updated Particle and Filter boolean inputs to use a visual toggle instead of a checkbox for better style and visibility
  - Added tooltips for all parameters with some brief details on what each means. Tooltips can be turned off in FXMaster settings.
  - Resolved hole areas that extended outside a regions bounds causing effects to crash
  - Resolved hole areas that extended outside a regions bounds not masking filter or particle effects properly
  - Resolved console error regarding window position that could appear if switching between scenes quickly with a Particle or Filter window open
  - Resolved ellipses created using the ALT hotkey for a perfect circle not being accounted for in general region handling due to a type mismatch
  - Resolved belowTokens mask cutout not working correctly when a token was not controlled and under an occluded tile
  - Improve Below Tokens option when using Dynamic Token Rings. Further improvement needed but should give better coverage now.
- Particle Effects:
  - Added new Shadow Only option to the Clouds particle effect. This works when the new V7 Shadow option is on, and will cause only the shadows of clouds to display on the canvas.
  - Improved performance of Clouds new Shadow effect, and fixed shadow effect jitter when windows display scale > 100%
  - Modified belowTokens option for Particle Effects. Stashing effects in different layers turned out to be pretty brittle, so Particles now use the same Filters approach which cuts a mask for a given token. Byproduct of this approach is the belowTokens true option now also maintains effects that play above darkness, above darkness.
  - Increased performance of Particle Effects generally by pooling render texture requests
  - Resolved foundry native overhead occlusion filters for FXMaster particle effects not working
- Filter Effects:
  - Resolved multiple polygon shapes on a single region with an Edge Fade % defined not working properly. Note: Rectangle and Ellipse type region shapes do not support Edge Fade % when creating multiple shapes on a single region.
  - Resolved Thunder Aware mode for the Lightning Filter displaying as usable for V12 users. This option was made possible via a new V13 api and so unfortunately is not supported in V12.
  - Resolved Fog Filter Effect not correctly applying Tint options
  - Resolved ghosting of token and region masks while panning/zooming, which was especially visible for the color filter when Below Tokens was on.
- Animation Effects:
  - Moved the Refresh Animations Database option from the settings menu into the Animation Effects window, and added a toggle for whether to include thumbnail processing
  - Massively improved thumbnail processing time when Refresh Animations Database runs with that option set
  - Improved thumbnail processing for JB2A to better match various string patterns they use
  - Added an Image Popout for Animation Effects when left clicking
  - Added Animation Effects support for new modules Eskie Effects and Eskie Effects Free, module includes thumbnails which are also processed alongside JB2A's
  - Removed Anchor parameter config when modifying animations. This option doesn't make sense when you can place the cursor exactly where you want the animation to be, so removing saves a bit of data on the db object
- Added Czech language support. Thanks Lethrendis!

## [v7.0.0] - 2025-10-27
Welcome to Gambit's FXMaster V7! DO NOT update to this version right before a session, it contains BREAKING CHANGES.
- BREAKING: Drawing based masks have been fully removed, along with the Invert Particle Effect Mask controls button. The reason for this is simple, drawings were never meant to support a masking system. Regions are able to do everything drawings could do and more. Now on to the fun changes!
- Filter Effects:
  - Gigantic overhaul, re-written from the ground up with custom shaders
  - Effects can now be placed on a region with the new 'FXMaster: Filter Effects' region behavior
  - Effects are now constrained to the bounds of a scene instead of the entire canvas
  - Effects can now be suppressed, either globally via Suppress Weather, or with a new 'FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters' Region Behavior
  - Region Effects now have a Edge Fade % parameter, which softens the edges of a Region for more realistic visualizations
  - Added a Thunder Aware audio mode for the Lightning effect. Increased max period for lightning effect to allow longer durations between lightning flashes
- Particle Effects:
  - Effects can now be suppressed either globally via Suppress Weather, or with a new 'FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles' Region Behavior
  - Increased max available density for rats particle effect
  - Modified fade-in and fade-out time for particle effects to a 5 second default, down from 20 seconds
  - Updated Particle Masking and Particle Emissions to better work with modules that create weird regions, ie Terrain Mapper
  - Updated Particle Effects Window to better handle resizes in combination with effect expansion
  - Updated Cloud Effect with new Shadow options
  - Updated Stars and Embers effects to play above the lighting layer, allowing them to be visible in darkness
  - Updated Rain effect to include a Splash parameter. Removed the separate Rain No Splash effect
  - Updated Rain Top Down effect to include a Splash parameter.
- Particle & Filter Effects:
  - Suppression via Suppress Weather, FXMaster: Suppress Scene Filters, or FXMaster: Suppress Scene Particles only effect Scene level filters and particles, meaning a region specific Filter or Particle effect can be overlayed on top of a Suppression behavior region.
  - Effects can now be placed above or below a token
    - New Scene and Region Below Tokens option per Particle and Filter Effect. When off, particles display above tokens. When on, particles display below tokens.
  - Effects now respect elevation when used on a region
    - New region behavior option Elevation Constraints. None - Region is always visible. Tokens POV - Region is restricted to any controlled tokens pov at a given elevation. Specific Tokens POV - Set of controlled tokens that are valid to see an effect at a given elevation.
  - Updated effects to pull currently active parameters for a scene instead of always using passive defaults when relevant
  - Updated effects to change to active scenes parameter options when a scene is changed instead of maintaining parameter options from the original scene, when relevant
  - Updated effects to display parameter output values in real time when using the arrow keys to make adjustments
- Added animation effect support for Baileywiki modules assets
- Updated localization file layouts, many new keys added but structure was ported and translation was ported/added where possible across all existing files. 
- Many more small bugfixes and tweaks

## [v6.0.11] - 2025-08-29

- Added a few localization keys for July's new FXMaster+ effects
- Updated pt-br and pl translations, thanks Kharmans and Lioheart!

## [v6.0.7] - 2025-07-16
- Updated Clear Particle and Filter Effects button dialog to dialogV2. Now clears Particle and Filter Sidebar controls buttons highlighting immediately.
- Resolve issue with region masking on one scene applying across multiple scenes even if no region was present on other scenes
- Updated the onUpdateParticleEffects api to allow the particle effects app window buttons to end effects when relevant
- Added additional logging to animation effects to give clearer direction if no animation files are found
- Additional localization keys added

## [v6.0.6] - 2025-07-09
- Resolve issue with region initialization being done too late causing an issue where tokens were unable to move
- Resolve issue with the 'Suppress Weather' region behavior not working for ellipse and polygon region types
- Couple small bugfixes for css button color assignment

## [v6.0.5] - 2025-07-08
- Resolve doubling up of the initial Animation Module scan when switching scenes
- Removed thumbnail scan on first Animation Module scan. The process can take quite a while, especially on hosted services, so it will only be run when done manually through the Module settings page.

## [v6.0.4] - 2025-07-07
- Resolve Particle Effects window not auto-adjusting size based on dropdown expansion
- Removed !important css tags that were unnecessary
- Added updated pt-BR and pl translations from Kharmans and Lioheart. Thanks!

- Add UI notification error if attempting to open the Animation Effects window without the Animations DB being properly built

## [v6.0.0] - 2025-07-06
FXMaster Version 6! Big visual and functional overhaul. V12 & V13 compatible. Removed all previously deprecated code. To reduce module size - removed individual animation assets hosted within the module and converted all module image assets to webp from png. Added and updated a number of localization keys. Changed module name to Gambit's FXMaster to align with my other modules, identifiers remains unchanged. Overview of the updates below, although I'm sure there will be some stuff I missed!
- Filter Effects
  - Re-wrote the menu for application v2!
  - Toggles can now be enabled and disabled individually. Toggle parameters will be updated in real time when making a change, and parameters will remember the last set value. 
  - Window position will be saved based off last placement.
- Particle Effects
  - Re-wrote the menu for application v2!
  - Toggles can now be enabled and disabled individually.
  - Toggle parameters will be updated in real time when making a change, and parameters will remember the last set value.
  - Window position will be saved based off last placement, along with window width.
  - App updated for a 3 column layout. This can be adjusted by re-sizing the app window, single column width is still supported.
  - NEW: Region support! You can now add particle effects to a region with the 'FXMaster: Particle Effects' region behavior.
  - NEW: Regions now support masking scene level particle effects, which can be applied with the 'Suppress Weather' region behavior. This respects FXMasters invert particle effect mask scene tool as well.
- Animation Effects (Previously Special Effects)
  - Complete overhaul. The goal of this re-work was to remove seldom used features and focus on giving this window an identity. In my mind that was a tool that allows flexible previewing and searching of animations.
  - FXMaster no longer supports features that overlapped with Sequencer, Sequencer is just better (much better) at those things. Placing animations via drag-drop as a tile is still supported, and the scale and anchor parameters can still be set on each animation.
  - App now displays animations in a grid. The window can be re-sized to change animation sizes for large previews on hover.
  - Animation details can be viewed and include file name, file path, and sequencer db path where relevant.
  - NEW: Added search functionality with more advanced query support via AND, OR, and NOT. As an example, this will allow searching for any animation with eldritch in the name but not blast - ex: eldritch AND NOT blast
  - NEW: Added support for all major animation modules. Animations db will be built on first load after update based off modules present. The Animations db can be re-built at any time through the FXMaster settings page if animation modules are added, updated, or removed.
  - NEW: Added support for custom animation folders. This can be specified in the FXMaster settings page.
  - NEW: Added the ability to favorite animations, these will be accessible as a dropdown filter tag along with the major animation authors and custom folder

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. See [standard-version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) for commit guidelines.

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/compare/v2.7.0...v3.0.0) (2022-07-17)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* * Support for v9 has been dropped
* Weather effects have been renamed to particle effects:
  * The hooks `fxmaster.updateWeather`, `fxmaster.switchWeather` have been
    replaced by `fxmaster.updateParticleEffects` and
	`fxmaster.switchParticleEffect`. Compatibility shims exist but will be
	removed in v4.
  * Properties of `canvas.fxmaster` have been renamed (`weather` =>
    `particleEffectsContainer`, `weatherEffects` => `particleEffects`,
	`drawWeather` => `drawParticleEffects`)
  * `CONFIG.fxmaster.weather` is deprecated and has been replaced by
    `CONFIG.fxmaster.particleEffects`. A compatibility shim still exists
	but it will be removed in v4.
* The hook `fxmaster.drawWeather` has been removed
* Many assets have been moved. For the most important things (e.g. macro
  icons), there are migration, but not for everything.
* The possibility to apply filters only to specific canvas layers has been
  removed (unfortunately necessary due to changes in foundry core).
* The implementation of the masking functionality has changed completely,
  which very likely breaks compatibility with modules such as
  Weather Blocker and Perfect Vision, which have been patching that
  functionality.
* The `updateMask` hook has been removed.

### Features

* add support for Foundry Virtual Tabletop v10 ([d8c48a4](https://github.com/ghost-fvtt/fxmaster/commit/d8c48a435ff42c73d9e5036b1c73cd4ba93f4766))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* remove `canvas.fxmaster.playVideo`, use
`canvas.specials.playVideo` instead.
* In foundry V9, it's not possible anymore to manipulate
the permissions in `CONST`. For that reason, it was necessary to switch
to using a setting instead. Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to
to migrate from the old way to the new way, so users will have to adapt
their settings to match what they had configured previously.
* A lot of things have been moved around. In particular, the es modules
  * module/controls.js
  * filterEffects/FilterManager.js
  * filterEffects/filtersDB.js
  * specialEffects/specialsDB.js
  * specialEffects/SpecialsLayer.js
  * weatherEffects/weatherDB.js

  do not exist anymore. Asset files also have been moved.
