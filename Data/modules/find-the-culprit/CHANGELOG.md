  - Should be at least as accessible as the old UI, post an issue if you have advice on this front
  - Modules now have three possible states
    - Suspect, equivalent to unlocked & unchecked, enabled and disabled as normal
    - Pinned, equivalent to locked or checked, always active during the search
    - Excluded, new option to remove a module from the search (useful for pure asset modules etc)
  - Left click cycles up the state list, right click down
  - Usage instructions have been moved to their own dialog, along with caveats and disclaimers
    - Dialog will appear the first time you open the main FtC app each page refresh
    - Has an option to disable the above behaviour
    - Can be rendered via the Instructions button in the main app
  - Added button to restart with "Zero Modules" (other than FtC) enabled, for quick sanity checks
- Implemented new algorithm for splitting mods in half between steps
  - Attempts to keep dependency chains together when possible, should reduce false positives
  - By default will shuffle the members of the list once dependencies are accounted for
    - This behaviour is toggleable via the Shuffle/Deterministic toggle button
